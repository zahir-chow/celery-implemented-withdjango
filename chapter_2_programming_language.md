## Review Questions

### Question 1
**In what year was Plankalkül designed? In what year was that design published?**

**Answer:**
- **Designed:** 1945
- **Published:** 1972

Plankalkül was designed by Konrad Zuse in 1945, making it the first high-level programming language ever designed. However, due to various circumstances including the post-war period and lack of computer availability, the design wasn't published until 1972, long after other programming languages had been developed and implemented.

---

### Question 2
**What two common data structures were included in Plankalkül?**

**Answer:**
The two common data structures included in Plankalkül were:

1. **Arrays** - For storing sequences of data elements
2. **Records** - For grouping related data fields together

These data structures were quite advanced for their time and influenced later programming languages.

---

### Question 3
**How were the pseudocodes of the early 1950s implemented?**

**Answer:**
The pseudocodes of the early 1950s were implemented through **interpreters**. These interpreters would:

- Read the pseudocode instructions
- Translate them on-the-fly into machine code
- Execute the translated instructions immediately

This approach was necessary because:
- Compilers were not yet developed
- Computers had limited memory
- Programs were typically small and run interactively

---

### Question 4
**Speedcoding was invented to overcome two significant shortcomings of the computer hardware of the early 1950s. What were they?**

**Answer:**
Speedcoding was invented to overcome these two significant shortcomings:

1. **Lack of floating-point hardware** - Early computers could only perform integer arithmetic, but scientific computing required floating-point operations
2. **Lack of indexing hardware** - Early computers had no built-in support for array indexing, making array operations very difficult

Speedcoding provided software solutions for both of these hardware limitations.

---

### Question 5
**Why was the slowness of interpretation of programs acceptable in the early 1950s?**

**Answer:**
The slowness of interpretation was acceptable in the early 1950s because:

- **Computers were extremely expensive** - The cost of hardware far outweighed the cost of programmer time
- **Programs were typically small** - Most programs were relatively short and simple
- **Development time was more important** - Getting programs written quickly was more valuable than execution speed
- **Limited alternatives** - Assembly language programming was extremely tedious and error-prone
- **Interactive computing** - Programs were often run interactively with human input, making execution time less critical

**Answer:**
Ruby's arithmetic operators are unique because they are **methods that can be overridden**, not built-in operators.

**Ruby's operator overloading:**
- **Everything is a method call** - `a + b` is actually `a.+(b)`
- **Customizable operators** - Classes can define their own behavior for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.
- **Consistent with OOP** - Operators follow the same rules as other methods
- **Polymorphic** - Different classes can have different implementations of the same operator

**Example:**
```ruby
class Vector
  def +(other)
    Vector.new(@x + other.x, @y + other.y)
  end
end
```

**Contrast with other languages:**

### Problem 12
**Describe, in your own words, the concept of orthogonality in programming language design.**

**Answer:**

**Orthogonality in Programming Languages:**

**Definition:** Orthogonality means that language features can be combined in any meaningful way without restrictions or special cases.

**Key Principles:**
- **Consistent Combination:** Any feature can be used with any other feature
- **No Special Cases:** Features work the same way regardless of context
- **Minimal Primitive Concepts:** Small set of basic building blocks
- **Predictable Behavior:** Features behave consistently across all combinations

**Examples of Orthogonality:**

**Good (Orthogonal):**
```algol68
# All data types can be used in all contexts
int x, y;
real a, b;
bool flag;

# All operations work with all types
x := y + 1;        # int + int
a := b * 2.0;      # real * real
flag := x > y;     # comparison returns bool
```

**Bad (Non-Orthogonal):**
```c
# Arrays and pointers behave differently
int arr[10];
int *ptr;

arr = ptr;         # ERROR: arrays can't be assigned
ptr = arr;         # OK: arrays decay to pointers
sizeof(arr);       # returns array size
sizeof(ptr);       # returns pointer size
```

**Benefits:**
- **Easier to Learn:** Fewer special cases to remember
- **More Powerful:** Features can be combined in unexpected ways
- **Consistent:** Predictable behavior across the language
- **Efficient:** Compiler can optimize consistently

- **Slow Development:** Committees move slowly and inefficiently
- **Feature Bloat:** Everyone wants their pet features included

**Unsuccessful Examples:**
- **ALGOL 68:** Committee design led to over-complexity
- **Ada:** Military committee created overly complex language
- **Some C++ features:** Committee additions sometimes problematic

**Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds):**

**Successful Model:**
1. **Strong Leadership:** Single designer or small team makes initial decisions
2. **Community Input:** Gather feedback from users and implementers
3. **Iterative Design:** Refine based on practical experience
4. **Final Authority:** Design lead makes final decisions

**Examples of Successful Hybrid Approaches:**
- **Python:** Guido van Rossum with community input
- **Rust:** Mozilla team with strong community involvement
- **Go:** Google team with open development process

**Recommendation:**
Committee design works best when there's strong technical leadership and clear decision-making authority. Pure committee design often leads to compromise and complexity, while pure individual design may miss important requirements.

- **Eval Functions:** Execute code generated at runtime
- **Reflection:** Introspection and modification of running programs

**Examples of Dynamic Features:**
```python
# Dynamic typing
x = 42          # x is an integer
x = "hello"     # x is now a string
x = [1, 2, 3]   # x is now a list

# Dynamic method calls
method_name = "upper"
result = getattr("hello", method_name)()
```

**Benefits:**
- **Metaprogramming:** Programs that write programs
- **Plugin Systems:** Dynamic loading of extensions
- **Configuration:** Runtime modification of behavior
- **Testing:** Dynamic test generation

**Why Pure Interpretation Works:**

**Performance is Secondary:**
- **Scripting Context:** Often used for glue code, not performance-critical

- **Short Execution:** Scripts often run briefly
- **User Interaction:** Human interaction time masks interpretation overhead

**Modern Hardware:**
- **Fast Processors:** Interpretation overhead less significant
- **Abundant Memory:** Can afford memory overhead of interpretation
- **Optimized Interpreters:** Modern interpreters are highly optimized

**Examples of Successful Pure Interpretation:**
- **Python:** Dominant in data science, web development, automation
- **JavaScript:** Universal web programming language
- **PHP:** Powers much of the web
- **Ruby:** Popular for web development and automation
- **Perl:** Text processing and system administration

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- **Performance:** Slower than compiled code
