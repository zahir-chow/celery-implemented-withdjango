# Redis Connection Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Your Django application with Celery was failing to connect to Redis with the error:
```
socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
```

The application was trying to connect to `redis:6379` instead of the correct Render Redis service name `django-cv-redis:6379`.

## Root Cause
1. **Environment Variable Mismatch**: The `render.yaml` configuration was correct, but there was a mismatch between the expected Redis service name and what the application was trying to connect to.
2. **Missing Database Number**: The Redis URLs in `render.yaml` were missing the database number (`/0`).
3. **No Fallback Logic**: The application didn't have proper fallback logic to handle different deployment environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `render.yaml`
- Updated all Redis URLs to include the database number (`/0`)
- Changed from `redis://django-cv-redis:6379` to `redis://django-cv-redis:6379/0`

### 2. Enhanced `async_demo/settings_production.py`
- Added comprehensive Redis configuration with fallback logic
- Added automatic detection of Render deployment environment
- Added debug logging to help troubleshoot connection issues
- Added Redis connection testing on startup
- Added retry logic and timeout configurations
- Added automatic correction of Redis service names

### 3. Improved `async_demo/celery.py`
- Added additional Celery configuration for better Redis handling
- Added retry logic and connection settings
- Added worker configuration for better reliability

### 4. Created Debug Tools
- `test_redis_connection.py`: Standalone Redis connection test
- `debug_redis.py`: Django-integrated Redis debug tool
- `tasksapp/management/commands/test_redis.py`: Django management command for Redis testing

## How to Test the Fix

### Local Testing
1. **Test Redis connection**:
   ```bash
   python test_redis_connection.py
   ```

2. **Test with Django settings**:
   ```bash
   python debug_redis.py
   ```

3. **Test using Django management command**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test_redis
   ```

### Deployment Testing
1. **Deploy to Render**: The changes should automatically fix the Redis connection issue
2. **Check logs**: Look for the debug messages in the Render logs to confirm the correct Redis URLs are being used
3. **Test Celery tasks**: Try using the `/add/` endpoint to test if Celery tasks work properly

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Startup logs should show**:
   ```
   DEBUG: Detected Render deployment environment
   DEBUG: Updated CELERY_BROKER_URL to: redis://django-cv-redis:6379/0
   DEBUG: Redis connection test successful
   ```

2. **Celery tasks should work** without the previous connection errors

3. **No more Redis connection retry errors** in the logs

## Files Modified
- `render.yaml` - Fixed Redis URLs
- `async_demo/settings_production.py` - Enhanced Redis configuration
- `async_demo/celery.py` - Improved Celery configuration
- Created debug tools for testing

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Deploy to Render
3. Monitor the logs to confirm the fix is working
4. Test the Celery functionality by using the `/add/` endpoint

The fix should resolve the Redis connection issues and allow your Celery tasks to work properly on Render.
